BEST ANSWER FROM DISCUSSION
n, m = raw_input().split()

sc_ar = raw_input().split()

A = set(raw_input().split())
B = set(raw_input().split())
print sum([(i in A) - (i in B) for i in sc_ar])

##did not think that I could have assigned the stdin in different line, would have been easier
##line 33 was clever to use Trues as 1 and False as 0s and then map
